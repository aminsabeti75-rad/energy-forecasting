# Energy Consumption Forecasting

##  Overview
This project predicts short-term energy consumption using a lightweight regression model.
It demonstrates how simple machine learning methods can be used for industrial forecasting tasks.

##  Method
- Generates synthetic daily energy consumption data.
- Trains a linear regression model to learn the trend.
- Predicts and visualizes the next 7 days of energy usage.

##  Files
- code/energy_predict.py — main model implementation
- requirements.txt — required Python libraries

##  Requirements
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


##  Run
bash
python code/energy_predict.py


##  Future Work
- Extend to multi-feature forecasting (temperature, season, production load).
- Convert model to TinyML version for deployment on embedded devices.
- Integrate with IoT sensors for real-time prediction.
